#### Intro
The first principles way of thinking is a method for learning and building knowledge. 

>First assumptions of what this is all about: 
>First establish what are the fundamental principles that govern a certain idea, then abstract that away from the manipulation of the fundamentals of the idea into something else.

Let's start building this idea with league of legends as its basis:

- What are the fundamental principles of League of Legends and it's gameplay
	1. The game is approximately symmetric.
	2. Game ends when one nexus explodes.
	3. Minions spawn every few seconds.
	4. Teams are composed of five champions, all of which are, mostly speaking, fitting into a certain role: Top, Mid, Jungle, Bottom, Support
	5. Champions can buy items for gold, that which can be gain by slaying minions, enemy champions, objectives, or passively
	
	
	
From writing the above rules, I have come up with some ideas as to what is the objective, and how to apply the first principles thinking, especially with this obsidian app.

1. Starting from the most obvious topics, they can always transition through linking to the more nuanced ones
2. I can also organize linking hierarchy by abstracting the details away from the parent document if possible, and putting the details in the child documents.

It is also important to highlight about something you don't know, and create a topic about it. Perhaps create a todo and using a plugin to manage them, or just creating a topic on its own, putting the title as TODO, and then querying the search. 

First principles: Basically just break down concepts into its basic fundamentals. While breaking down, start linking them, and prioritize filling the gaps to what is useful.
