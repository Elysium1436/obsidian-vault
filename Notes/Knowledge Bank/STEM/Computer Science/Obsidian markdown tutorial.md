	- You can Indent dashes by pressing \<TAB\> 
	- Next item will also be indented

Here in obsidian, you can copy an *image* to your clipboard and paste it. A file will appear on the obsidian directory. You can change in the settings where you want your file to be, either in a specific folder, or the folder where your file is currently at, or a subfolder.
