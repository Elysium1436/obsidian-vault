### Headings are just tic tac toe symbols
##### More tic tac toes mean smoller heading
###### Triple dashes put a big line, but he's shy so he needs some space

# Lists
- Just a dash then space will do the trick
- Once you've created a list, when you press enter, you won't need to press dash again, it creates  one for you :)
	- You can Indent dashes by pressing \<TAB\> 
	- Next item will also be indented
		- ANOTHER NESTED INDENTATION?? HOLY SHIT POGGERS
			1. This is how you do a numbered list
			2. Pretty cool huh?
			3. You just press a number, then period, then 

If you press \<ENTER> two times, you can exit this list thingy
