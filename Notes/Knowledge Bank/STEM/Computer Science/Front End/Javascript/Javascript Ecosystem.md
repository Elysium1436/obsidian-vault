##### To compile or not compile?
You can run javascript directly from the browser, but there are some cases where you need a compiler.
- If you need to support old browsers, you'll want a "transpiler" to be able to use new js features in old browsers. The most popular ones are [[Babel]] and [[Typescript]].
- To use certain frameworks, like for example, the [[React]] framework, you are going to write jsx code. To convert it into something that the browsers will understand,  you'll need a preprocessor (like [[Babel]]).
- If you want to "minify" your code to use les sbandwith, you can use stuff like UglifyJS, JSMin, and Closure Compiler
- You can also code in a different language and transpile it to javascript.
