## Perspective

There are three css elements that pertain to "perspective":

- The `perspective` and `perspective-origin` properties
- The `perspective()` transform function.

The `perspective` property defines how far the user is from the z=0 plane. The [[vanishing point]] is automatically set to the center of the element, but can be changed by setting the [[css-property -- perspective-origin]] property.
