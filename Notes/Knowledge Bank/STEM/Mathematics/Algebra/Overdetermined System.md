## Overdetermined System
A system of equations that has more [[Constraints]] (Equations) then [[Degrees Of Freedom]] (variables) is said to be an **Overdetermined System**. Basically, more equations than independent variables. What generally happens is that, either the system is **inconsistent** (has no solutions), or one or more equations or identical, or a [[Linear Combination]] of one or more other equations in the same system.
