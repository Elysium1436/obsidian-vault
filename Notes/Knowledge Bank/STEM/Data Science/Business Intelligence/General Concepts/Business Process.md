### Business Process

A Business Process is a sequence of activities or tasks done by equipment or people in which to produce a service or product for a particular customer or customers. Defining effective Business Processes will improve customer satisfaction, agility, and break down between departments and avoid [[Information Silo | information/functional silos]].

Business Processes can be organized into three types:
- Operational Processes, which is the set of actions that the core objective of the company is built upon to create the main value stream.
- Managment Processes, which oversees the operational processes eg. corporate governance, budgetary oversight and employee oversight.
- Supporting processes, which supports the operational processes, e.g. accounting, recruitment, call centar, technical support, etc.

Another way of differentiating different Processes are:

1. Operational processes, which focus on properly executing the operational tasks of an entity; this is where personnel "get the things done"
2. Management processes, which ensure that the operational processes are conducted appropriately; this is where managers "ensure efficient and effective work processes"
3. Governance processes, which ensure the entity is operating in full compliance with necessary legal regulations, guidelines, and shareholder expectations; this is where executives ensure the "rules and guidelines for business success" are followed

In any case, this highlights the importance of dividing labors into atomical components and distributing each of them to a select few.
